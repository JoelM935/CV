## Employment History  
### Principle Data Scientist at UK Health Security Agency, London
#### July 2023 - Present 
**Health Analytics and Automation Team**
- Started a project using geospatial data to map urban heat islands in London and how they affect health outcomes. Making use of R geospatial packages.
- Leading 2 report automation work-streams, building solutions using R-markdown bespoke to the stakeholder's requirements. 
- Leading a work-stream to standardise COVID-19 variant incident response across the organisation. Bringing together multiple teams to produce a single output which can be rapidly deployed to support incident response.
- Lead developer on a Python package to support users in the creation of automated slide decks.

### Data Scientist at UK Health Security Agency, London
#### April 2022 - July 2023
**Health Analytics and Automation Team**
- Major contributor to the COVID-19 automated slide pack. This relies on a large Python codebase and AWS. Facilitated a reduction from 60k to 10k lines of code, providing significant speed increase and an 85% reduction in operating costs.
- Supported incident responses, delivering data analysis and visualisations on high-priority public health situations at pace.
- Worked at pace on a greenfield project using Python to extract data from disease notification forms into a tabular form.
- Lead a team of 5 data scientists on a project to automate the production of TB reports using R-markdown, reducing the production time from 2 days to ~30 seconds.
- Developed code to fine-tune a pre-trained LLM, producing a binary classification model with >90% accuracy. This model was then applied to free text data to identify whether individuals who were exposed to avian influenza were using PPE during exposure.
