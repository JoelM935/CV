I have over seven years of experience applying data science techniques across academia and public health, and nearly 15 years of experience in computer programming over eight different languages. I am a self-driven individual with a scientific mindset, who loves building tools, solving problems and learning. I am also an international athlete who has represented Great Britain at the senior level, competing in many high-pressure scenarios.

## Employment History  
### Principle Data Scientist at UK Health Security Agency, London
#### July 2023 - Present
**Health Analytics and Automation Team**
- Lead developer on a Python package for creating automated slide decks. Data is pulled from S3, SQL databases or local files, with pandas used for data manipulation and Ploty for data visualisations. This package has enabled hours of recurring work to be automated.
- Created a Python package to simplify authentication when connecting to AWS from our analytics platform. Reduces terminal commands and many lines of code to a single line. This has been well-received by other data scientists and has increased efficiency.
- Took an existing internal report that was manually created each month using Excel spreadsheets, with data received by email. Designed and built a new data pipeline and automated generation using Python. This saves three days of work each month.
- Automated two GOV.UK reports using R markdown, saving 10 days of analyst time per production cycle and improving quality.
- Leading a review of wastewater analysis conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. Investigating the discrepancy between the infection rate predicted from wastewater by linear regression models and the COVID-19 Infection Survey.
- Conducted a data quality review of a SQL database following the identification of an ingestion error. Measured impacts and made recommendations to key stakeholders.
- Created and delivered training sessions on Python and Git to interns. These were rated in the top three sessions they received.
- Managed and trained three employees who were promoted shortly afterwards, with two going from non-coding to coding roles.


### Data Scientist at UK Health Security Agency, London
#### April 2022 - July 2023
**Health Analytics and Automation Team**
- Improved a high-profile COVID-19 product built using a large object-oriented Python codebase and AWS. Reduced 60k lines of code to 10k, significantly increased speed and reduced operating costs by 85%. I also improved the visualisations to improve clarity and provide a consistent look and feel.
- Supported incident responses, delivering data analysis and visualisations on high-priority public health situations at pace.
- Worked to a tight deadline on a greenfield project using Python to extract data from PDF forms into a tabular form. This provided a solution where the existing manual process could not process forms fast enough during an outbreak.
- Led a team of 5 data scientists on a project to automate the production of a regular GOV.UK report using R-markdown. This reduced the production time from 2 days to ∼30 seconds.
- Trained an LLM using Pytorch and HPC, producing a binary classification model with >90% accuracy. This model was then applied to free text data to improve reporting on Avian Influenza.
